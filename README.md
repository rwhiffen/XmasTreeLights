My Christmas Tree Lights project

This all started with the video by Matt Parker from [@standupmaths](https://github.com/standupmaths/), and his video ["I wired my tree with 500 LED lights and calculated their 3D coordinates"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvlpIojusBE).

This is my hack at it.   

Things I need to write up:

* The gear I'm using
* The trouble I had with GPIO 18 vs GPIO 21
* Making it work with a Circuit Playground BlueFruit first
